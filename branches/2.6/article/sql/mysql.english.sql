Though\r\nstarted as a portal system, XOOPS is in fact striving steadily on the\r\ntrack of Content Management System. It can serve as a web framework for\r\nuse by small, medium and large sites.<br /><br />A lite XOOPS can be used\r\nas a personal weblog or journal. For this purpose, you can do a\r\nstandard install, and use its News module only. For a medium site, you\r\ncan use modules like News, Forum, Download, Web Links etc to form a\r\ncommunity to interact with your members and visitors. For a large site\r\nas an enterprise one, you can develop your own modules such as eShop,\r\nand use XOOP''s uniform user management system to seamlessly integrate\r\nyour modules with the whole system.<br /><br /><strong>Pronunciation guide</strong><br />The standard pronunciation of XOOPS should follow English rules, and you should pronounce it as [zoo''ps].<br /><br /><strong>Key features of XOOPS</strong><br /><br />- Database-driven<br />XOOPS uses a relational database (currently MySQL) to store data required for running a web-based content management system.<br /><br />- Fully Modularized<br />Modules can be installed/uninstalled/ativated/deactivated with a click using the XOOPS module administration system.<br /><br />- Personalization<br />Registered users can edit their profiles, select site themes, upload custom avatars, and much more!<br /><br />- User Management<br />The\r\nability to search for users by various criteria, send email and private\r\nmessages to users through a template-based messaging system.<br /><br />- Supported World-wide<br />XOOPS\r\nwas created and is maintained by a team of several hard-working\r\nvolunteers working from all over the world. The XOOPS community has\r\nmore than dozen official support sites around the world for support of\r\nnon-English speaking users.<br /><br />- Multi-byte Language Support<br />Fully supports multi-byte languages, including Japanese, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Korean, etc.<br /><br />- Versatile Group Permissions System<br />Powerful and user-friendly permissions system which enables administrators to set permissions by group.<br /><br />- Theme-based skinnable interface<br />XOOPS\r\nis driven by a powerful theme system.

By contrast,\r\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\r\nshare and change free software--to make sure the software is free for\r\nall its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation''s software and to any other program whose authors\r\ncommit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\r\ncovered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can\r\napply it to your programs, too.<br /><br />When we speak of free software,\r\nwe are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are\r\ndesigned to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of\r\nfree software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you\r\nreceive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\r\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you\r\nknow you can do these things.<br /><br />To protect your rights, we need to\r\nmake restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask\r\nyou to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain\r\nresponsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or\r\nif you modify it.<br /><br />For example, if you distribute copies of such\r\na program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\r\nall the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too,\r\nreceive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms\r\nso they know their rights.<br /><br />We protect your rights with two\r\nsteps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which\r\ngives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the\r\nsoftware.<br /><br />Also, for each author''s protection and ours, we want\r\nto make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for\r\nthis free software. If the software is modified by someone else and\r\npassed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not\r\nthe original, so that any problems introduced by others will not\r\nreflect on the original authors'' reputations.<br /><br />Finally, any free\r\nprogram is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid\r\nthe danger that redistributors of a free program will individually\r\nobtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To\r\nprevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed\r\nfor everyone''s free use or not licensed at all.<br /><br />The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br /><br />GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br /><br />0.\r\nThis License applies to any program or other work which contains a\r\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\r\nunder the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,\r\nrefers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\r\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\r\nlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\r\nthe term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br /><br />Activities\r\nother than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\r\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the\r\nProgram is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered\r\nonly if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\r\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\r\nis true depends on what the Program does.<br /><br />1. You may copy and\r\ndistribute verbatim copies of the Program''s source code as you receive\r\nit, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\r\npublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of\r\nwarranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to\r\nthe absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\r\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.<br /><br />You may\r\ncharge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\r\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br /><br />2.\r\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,\r\nthus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\r\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that\r\nyou also meet all of these conditions:<br /><br />a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br /><br />b)\r\nYou must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole\r\nor in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,\r\nto be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\r\nterms of this License.<br /><br />c) If the modified program normally reads\r\ncommands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started\r\nrunning for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or\r\ndisplay an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\r\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\r\nwarranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\r\nconditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\r\n(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally\r\nprint such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not\r\nrequired to print an announcement.)<br /><br />These requirements apply to\r\nthe modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are\r\nnot derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered\r\nindependent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\r\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as\r\nseparate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a\r\nwhole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the\r\nwhole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\r\nlicensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part\r\nregardless of who wrote it.<br /><br />Thus, it is not the intent of this\r\nsection to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely\r\nby you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the\r\ndistribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.<br /><br />In\r\naddition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\r\nstorage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\r\nscope of this License.<br /><br />3. You may copy and distribute the\r\nProgram (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or\r\nexecutable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that\r\nyou also do one of the following:<br /><br />a) Accompany it with the\r\ncomplete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be\r\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,<br /><br />b) Accompany it\r\nwith a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third\r\nparty, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing\r\nsource distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\r\ncorresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\r\ninterchange; or,<br /><br />c) Accompany it with the information you\r\nreceived as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This\r\nalternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if\r\nyou received the program in object code or executable form with such an\r\noffer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br /><br />The source code for a\r\nwork means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to\r\nit. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source\r\ncode for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\r\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\r\ninstallation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the\r\nsource code distributed need not include anything that is normally\r\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components\r\n(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the\r\nexecutable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\r\nexecutable.<br /><br />If distribution of executable or object code is made\r\nby offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering\r\nequivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br /><br />4. You\r\nmay not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\r\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\r\nmodify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\r\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However,\r\nparties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\r\nLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\r\nremain in full compliance.<br /><br />5. You are not required to accept\r\nthis License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else\r\ngrants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\r\nderivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\r\naccept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the\r\nProgram (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your\r\nacceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions\r\nfor copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.<br /><br />6.\r\nEach time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\r\non the recipients'' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\r\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.<br /><br />7.\r\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license\r\nwould not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all\r\nthose who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the\r\nonly way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain\r\nentirely from distribution of the Program.<br /><br />If any portion of\r\nthis section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular\r\ncircumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the\r\nsection as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br /><br />It\r\nis not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous\r\ncontributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\r\nsystem in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up\r\nto the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\r\nsoftware through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\r\nchoice.<br /><br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br /><br />8.\r\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\r\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\r\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an\r\nexplicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\r\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\r\nnot thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\r\nlimitation as if written in the body of this License.<br /><br />9. The\r\nFree Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\r\nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\r\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.<br /><br />Each version is given a\r\ndistinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version\r\nnumber of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you\r\nhave the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\r\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this\r\nLicense, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.<br /><br />10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program\r\ninto other free programs whose distribution conditions are different,\r\nwrite to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\r\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software\r\nFoundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be\r\nguided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all\r\nderivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse\r\nof software generally.<br /><br />NO WARRANTY<br /><br />11. BECAUSE THE\r\nPROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\r\nPROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN\r\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\r\nEXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\r\nENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\r\nYOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\r\nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br /><br />12. IN NO EVENT\r\nUNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY\r\nCOPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE\r\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING\r\nANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT\r\nOF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED\r\nBY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY\r\nOTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF\r\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br /><br />END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>', 1, 1, 1, 1, 0),

Open source sprouted in the technological community as a response to proprietary software owned by corporations.\r\n\r\n(2) A certification standard issued by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) that indicates that the source code of a computer program is made available free of charge to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for this movement is that a larger group of programmers not concerned with proprietary ownership or financial gain will produce a more useful and bug -free product for everyone to use.\r\n\r\nThe concept relies on peer review to find and eliminate bugs in the program code, a process which commercially developed and packaged programs do not utilize. Programmers on the Internet read, redistribute and modify the source code, forcing an expedient evolution of the product.\r\n\r\nThe process of eliminating bugs and improving the software happens at a much quicker rate than through the traditional development channels of commercial software as the information is shared throughout the open source community and does not originate and channel through a corporation''s research and development cogs.\r\n\r\nOSI dictates that in order to be considered "OSI Certified" a product must meet the following criteria:\r\n\r\n* The author or holder of the license of the source code cannot collect royalties on the distribution of the program\r\n* The distributed program must make the source code accessible to the user\r\n* The author must allow modifications and derivations of the work under the program''s original name\r\n* No person, group or field of endeavor can be denied access to the program\r\n* The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program''s being part of a particular software distribution\r\n* The licensed software cannot place restrictions on other software that is distributed with it.\r\n\r\nFor full details please visit Open source definitions', 0, 1, 1, 1, 1),

(9, 4, 'Basic FAQ', '[b]- How do I install Article module?[/b]\r\nArticle installs as a standard Xoops module. \r\n\r\n[b]- How do I use search engine optimized URL?[/b]\r\nCurrently Article allows the following URL rule:\r\n"http://xoopsurl.com/modules/article/view.article.php?article=999&category=222" => "http://xoopsurl.com/modules/article/view.article.php/999/c222"\r\nConsider some server does not accept such URL rewrite, the preference is disabled in the module by default. To activate it, you need "[b]Enable URL rewrite[/b]" through "Preferences> Article>General settings"\r\n\r\n[b]- When I try to create uploads/article/file and uploads/article/image the folders are not created, what can I do?[/b]\r\nCreate these folders manually and give them world write permissions 0777\r\n\r\n[b]- Can I delete the pre-installed articles and categories?[/b]\r\nYou can delete the pre-installed articles, or put them in a non-public category for reference. All categories can be deleted also, except for one, which is required for the module operation. You can easily rename this to whatever you want.\r\n\r\n[b]- What is ''Utility'' used for?   [/b]\r\n"utility" is to be developed, mainly for static page generation, plugin management, as well as batch manipulation for articles (such as backup/restore, import from html files)\r\n \r\n[b]- What are keywords/Tags and how do I manage them ?[/b]\r\nKeywords/Tag can link or group articles together which share the same keywords/tag. A keyword/tag only becomes active if there is at least one other article in the module database which has the same keyword listed in the keyword field. When this happens the keywords automatically become a hyperlinks to a page that lists the other article(s). In this way you can quickly group articles together which share common keywords and make them easily reachable by readers and search engines. \r\n\r\n[b]- How do I display a list of keywords/tags?[/b]\r\nThere are blocks for tag presentation. It lists all the current active article keywords as hyperlinks. Also shows the number of articles sharing each keyword.\r\n\r\n[b]- What are Global keywords?[/b]\r\nGlobal keywords are set in modules preferences in the keyword field. They are written as follows: http://mylink.com MyLink This will produce a global hyperlink to http://mylink.com in any article whenever the word ''MyLink'' appears. This function will automatically convert the plain text into a hyperlink without an html tag. This can be an internal site link or external. You can of course turn this function off. \r\n\r\n[b]- What is the ''Transfer'' item? [/b]\r\nThe transfer item allows an article to be copied over to another application. Currently this supports external: social bookmark (del.icio.us, furl), email, PDF, print internal: newbb, article, dokuwiki, wordpress, xmline. More Will be available for next version. The transfer items is plugable, which means there is no limit on plugins.\r\nA bookmark plugin is being developed.\r\n\r\n[b]- What is the difference between ''Delete'' and ''Terminate'' ?[/b]\r\ndelete means forcing to remove an article; terminate means remove an article from a category, the article content still exists unless it is removed from all categories.\r\n\r\n[b]- What is the difference between ''View'' and ''Access'' in permissions?[/b]\r\n''view'' is for access to a full article. ''access'' is for access to a category. If you have ''access'' permission but not ''view'', you then can only read what is displayed on a category page, such as titles/authors/summaries.\r\n\r\n[b]-In the Article submit page, please explain the options:[/b]\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>[b]SUBMIT[/b] ~ sends the whole article for online publication. It will appear immeadiately or be moderated, according to admin options.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>[b]SAVE[/b] ~ saves the article as a private draft, which only you can view and access. Articles may be edited and submitted on a later session.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>[b]SAVE AND EDIT[/b] ~ saves the current article page into a temporary buffer, allowing you to continue editing or adding new pages.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>[b]PREVIEW[/b] ~ displays the article in published page view.\r\n</li>\r\n<li> [b]CANCEL[/b] ~ deletes the current submit session.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>[b]DELETE[/b] ~ deletes the article from the database.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n[b]- What is MYPAGE?[/b]\r\nThis is a private area which displays your list of cretaed and published articles only.\r\n\r\n[b]- What is "Topic"?[/b]\r\nBesides "category", Article also provides a pseudo-categorizing method "topic" allowing you collecting relevant articles to build a special series inside a category.', 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
