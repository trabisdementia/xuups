to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the Membership
icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow
the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

If you plan to use online block with online list, then you must import the ip-to-country list.
Please access membership administration and run the importer.
If you are runing PROTECTOR module than you must DISABLE IT first or change settings.
If you fail to do so, the script will be detected and stoped by protector as a Dos Attack.
