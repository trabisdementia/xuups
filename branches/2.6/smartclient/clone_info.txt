How can I clone this module ?
=============================

Cloning a module require some files manipulation. Let's take the folowing example : we want to clone SmartClient to have a new module called SmartGamer. Here is what you need to do :

- Change the directory name from modules/smartclient to modules/smartgamer
- With your favorite Find And Replace tool, find and replace these case sensitive strings :

  - smartclient => smartgamer
  - Smartclient => Smartgamer
  - SmartClient => SmartGamer
  - SMARTCLIENT => SMARTGAMER
  - SCLIENT => SGAMER
  
- Rename these files :

  - templates/smartclient_index.html to templates/smartgamer_index.html
  - templates/smartclient_join.html.html to templates/smartgamer_join.html.html
  - templates/smartclient_client.html.html to templates/smartgamer_client.html.html
  - templates/smartclient_pdf.html.html to templates/smartgamer_pdf.html.html
  
- You can also edit the language constants defined in smartgamer/language/ to reflect the new purpose of the module.

- You can also edit the image images/module_logo.png to avoid confusion with the original module.
