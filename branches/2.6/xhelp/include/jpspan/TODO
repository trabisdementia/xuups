++TODO

In rough order of priority...

- Other issues with i18n? MB strings?

    Status: Javascript strings are now serialized as utf8 so string
    lengths are correct for PHP. Probably more i18n issues to deal
    with (e.g. HTTP headers - charsets etc)

- Implement alternatives to Javascript extensions .toPHP() and
    var_dump() which _act on_ data structure but don't show
    up when looping through properties.
    
    Status: partially done - serializer now implemented. Needs
    an equivalent for var_dump

- Implement mechanism for attaching loggers (and other stuff)
    to servers (observer?)

- Implement alternative "network" mechanisms to XmlHttpRequest
    such as something using script src attribute.
    
    Status: messing with PseudoXmlHttpRequest which adapts
    approaches based on iframes to the XmlHttpRequest API. Right
    now _very_ broken.

- Explore / implement client/server authentication (sessions, HTTP digest)

    Status: partially complete - example provided with HTTP Basic
    auth

- Implement different types of server (alternatives to PostOffice)
    to allow different styles of RPC (REST?)

- Alternative encoding mechanisms? (e.g. native XML, XML-RPC, WDDX)


++DONE

Following things done (were TODO)

- (done 20041010) Allow for i18n error messages

- (done 20041010) Standardize error codes

    Status: complete

- (done 20040910) Implement timeout for XmlHttpClient requests
    Note this is only supported for async requests - not possible for sync requests
    as far as I know

- (done 20040909): Implement a PHP error handler which generates Javascript exceptions

- SECURITY issue (done 20040909): by hacking the serialized string sent to the server
    PHP can be tricked into creating "unplanned" objects. Currently
    ScriptServer checks for this in the ScriptServer_Unserializer class;
    the validate() method but by this time the object is already created
    and the constructor has run.
    A parser for the serialized strings is required which checks for
    illegal object before unserialization.
