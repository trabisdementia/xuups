How can I clone this module ?
=============================

Cloning this module has never been easier ! Thanks to our friend Sudhaker, you can now painlessly clone this module as many time as you like !

- Locate and edit the file smartpartner/clone.php.

- Locate these lines and change the second part of each line for what you need :

$patterns = array(
  // first one must be module directory name
  'smartpartner'  => 'smartclient', 
  'SMARTPARTNER'  => 'SMARTCLIENT',
  'SmartPartner'  => 'SmartClient',
  'Smart Partner' => 'Smart Client',
  'SPARTNER'      => 'SCLIENT',
  'Smartpartner'  => 'Smartclient' 
);

In this example, SmartPartner will be cloned into SmartClient.

- Save and close clone.php.

- Move clone.php file to the root of your web site.

- Be sure to have uploaded the smartpartner folder in the "modules" folder of your site.

- If your site is a local site on your computer, go to yoursite.com/clone.php.

- If your site is on the web, run this command php -q clone.php 

- Delete the file yoursite.com/clone.php

- You can also edit the language constants defined in smartparter/language/ to reflect the new purpose of the module.

- You can also edit the image images/module_logo.png to avoid confusion with the original module.
