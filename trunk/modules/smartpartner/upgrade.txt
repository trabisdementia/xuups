How to uprade from SmartPartner prior to 0.9
============================================

Unfortunatley, you will need to uninstall the module and reinstall it.


How to uprade from SmartPartner 0.9.x or 1.0 RC 1
=================================================

Upload the 'smartpartner' folder into xoops_root/modules/ and update the module via System Admin > Modules > SmartPartner > Update.

Also, the images folder holding the clients logo has changed so you need to do these extra steps :

- Go in SmartPartner > Administrative Section
- You will see the 'Module Path Configuration' block at the top of the page, asking you to create the image folder
- Click on 'Create the folder'
- Then, with an FTP client, move all the content of www.yoursite.com/images/smartpartner/ to www.yoursite.com/uploads/smartpartner/images/
- Enjoy !
