How could I change SmartPartner's directory ?
============================================

Currently, SmartPartner's module path is http://www.yousite.com/modules/smartpartner/. Since version 1.0.1, SmartPartner's code has been improved in order to make it easy for you to change the directory of the module to anything you would like !

PLEASE NOTE : You need to perform these steps BEFORE installing the module

Let's say you want to change the directory to 'clients'. Simply search for this line in the module : "This must contain the name of the folder in which reside SmartPartner".

You will find it in these 5 files :
- xoops_version.php
- blocks/partner_list.php
- include/common.php
- include/notification.inc.php
- include/search.inc.php

Simply change the SMARTPARTNER_DIRNAME constant to "partners" in each of these files, like this :

// This must contain the name of the folder in which reside SmartClient
if( !defined("SMARTPARTNER_DIRNAME") ){
    define("SMARTPARTNER_DIRNAME", 'partners');
}

And of course, you need to change the name of the folder containing the module to 'partners'. For example, you must change modules/smartpartner to modules/partners
    
And that's it !

Enjoy !
