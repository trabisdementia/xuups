How could I change SmartClient's directory ?
============================================

Currently, SmartClient's module path is http://www.yousite.com/modules/smartclient/. Since version 1.0.1, SmartClient's code has been improved in order to make it easy for you to change the directory of the module to anything you would like !

PLEASE NOTE : You need to perform these steps BEFORE installing the module

Let's say you want to change the directory to 'clients'. Simply search for this line in the module : "This must contain the name of the folder in which reside SmartClient".

You will find it in these 5 files :
- xoops_version.php
- blocks/client_list.php
- include/common.php
- include/notification.inc.php
- include/search.inc.php

Simply change the SMARTCLIENT_DIRNAME constant to "clients" in each of these files, like this :

// This must contain the name of the folder in which reside SmartClient
if( !defined("SMARTCLIENT_DIRNAME") ){
    define("SMARTCLIENT_DIRNAME", 'clients');
}

And of course, you need to change the name of the folder containing the module to 'clients'. For example, you must change modules/smartclient to modules/clients
    
And that's it !

Enjoy !
