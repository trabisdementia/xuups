What is Mycomments Module ?
======================

With this Xoops module, your users can keep a track of they recieved and sent comments.

The module can :
. display recieved comments by user
. display sent comments by user
. display the above per module
. include comments on your site search
. display a block with the last commented items (not last comments)
. etc


How to install Mycomments
====================

Copy mycomments folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then log in
to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the Mycomments
icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow
the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

This module makes use of plugins. Without plugins there will be nothing to see.
Available plugins are located at mycomments/plugins.


Developing plugins
====================

Plugins are based on the "What's new" module plugins. With little effort you can adpat them to work with my comments.
If you are a module developer you can include your plugins under yourmodule/include/mycomments.plugin.php
The plugin should also work for modules that use XOOPS_TRUST_PATH.

You can send your plugin to lusopoemas@gmail.com if you want me to add it to mycomments/plugins folder.
